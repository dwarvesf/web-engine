TaskRef: "Implement Layout component with Header and Footer in theme"

Learnings:
- Confirmed project uses idiomatic React/TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for layout.
- ESLint enforces import order and className order (e.g., 'flex min-h-screen flex-col').
- Header and Footer are colocated in the same directory, simplifying imports.
- Layout pattern: wrap children with Header and Footer for consistent page structure.

Difficulties:
- Initial attempt at replace_in_file failed due to mismatched SEARCH block (auto-formatting changed import order and quote style).
- ESLint rules required precise className and import order.

Successes:
- Used precise SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to fix import order and className order.
- Final Layout component matches project conventions and passes linting.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Always re-read the file after auto-formatting before further replace_in_file operations.
- For Tailwind className order, check ESLint/prettier rules to avoid repeated lint errors.
