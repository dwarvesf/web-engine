TaskRef: 'Update cta.tsx component'

Learnings:
  - Successfully updated a React component (`cta.tsx`) to match a new HTML structure.
  - Understood how to modify component props and destructure them in a functional component.
  - Correctly identified and replaced a UI component (`H2` to `H1`) and added a new one (`Paragraph`) from the `./ui` import.
  - Handled string replacement for newlines (`.replace(/\\n/g, '\n')`) within JSX props.
  - Adapted the component to a new HTML structure, including changes to `Section` props (`className`, `style`) and the internal `div` structure.
  - Adjusted Tailwind CSS classes to match the new layout requirements (e.g., `md:flex`, `md:w-1/2`, `md:mb-0`).
  - Added `ctaLink` and `ctaText` props to the component to support a call-to-action link.
  - Imported the `Link` component from `./ui` to resolve a "Cannot find name 'Link'" TypeScript error.

Difficulties:
  - Initial `replace_in_file` attempt failed due to a mismatch in the SEARCH block, likely caused by auto-formatting after the previous successful edit. This highlights the importance of using the `final_file_content` as the reference for subsequent `SEARCH` blocks.
  - Encountered a TypeScript error "Cannot find name 'Link'" after adding the `Link` component, which was resolved by explicitly importing it from `./ui`.

Successes:
  - The component was updated accurately and efficiently, respecting the existing shared component structure.
  - Successfully corrected the `replace_in_file` operation after an initial failure by referencing the latest file content.
  - Successfully added support for a CTA link with text and handled the necessary import.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Updating React functional components with new props and UI elements.
  - General pattern: Adapting React components to new HTML structures and styling requirements.
  - Workflow improvement: Always use the `final_file_content` provided after a successful `write_to_file` or `replace_in_file` operation as the exact `SEARCH` block content for subsequent `replace_in_file` calls to avoid mismatches due to auto-formatting.
  - Common error resolution: When adding new components, ensure they are properly imported from their respective modules.
